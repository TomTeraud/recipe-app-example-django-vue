This repository contains the frontend and backend source code for a recipe app that I built to learn more about web development and frontend-backend technologies.

Tech Stack
Backend: Django (chosen because I was already familiar with Python)
Frontend: Vue.js (selected instead of React because it seemed more beginner-friendly)
Docker: Used for containerization and deployment
Docker Setup
This repository includes two Docker Compose files:

compose.dev.yml – Builds the Docker image for the source code locally.
compose.yml – Pulls and runs the frontend and backend images from Docker Hub.
